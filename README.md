# mentality
Mentality is a mental health journaling and lifestyle tracking app for Android, developed by me in Android Studio. 
The app stores all data locally on your device for privacy reasons and in order to be compliant with GDPR. 
To use the app, please download the project, open it in android studio, and generate an APK that you can copy to your Android phone.
